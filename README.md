# Image-Processing-using-GluonCV

In this project, I try to get familiar with a new, flexible and efficient deep learning framework, Apache MXnet's GluonCV. It is an open source library for state of the art image processing to get started with.

So, to begin with, I implemented a classic example of digit recognizer on MNIST dataset. To accomplish this task, I use a LeNet-5 architecture for network definition.


The project is based on the course that I completed on Coursera. `AWS Computer Vision: Getting Started with GluonCV`. Here is the link for [completion certificate](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/MN65GHSHS6Q9).
